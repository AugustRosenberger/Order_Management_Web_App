# Order_Management_Web_App
Website that allows users to login and create, cancel, edit and viewcustomer orders, add new customers, and view records. MySQL is used as an external database for all data used (logins, orders, etc.)

The website uses PHP to query an series of online databases, the contents of those databases are found in the multiple .csv files in this repo. The online databse I used is MySQL, and so all of the generic server login info the .php files is what cooresponds to each variable (server url, username, paswword, etc.). Feel free to use this as a template for integrating sql databases in general.
